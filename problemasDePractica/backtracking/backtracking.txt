A backtracking algorithm works by recursively exploring all possible solutions to a problem. 
It starts by choosing an initial solution, and then it explores all possible extensions of 
that solution. If an extension leads to a solution, the algorithm returns that solution. 
If an extension does not lead to a solution, the algorithm backtracks to the previous solution
and tries a different extension.

The following is a general outline of how a backtracking algorithm works:

Choose an initial solution.
Explore all possible extensions of the current solution.
If an extension leads to a solution, return that solution.
If an extension does not lead to a solution, backtrack to the previous solution and try a different extension.
Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible solutions have been explored.
